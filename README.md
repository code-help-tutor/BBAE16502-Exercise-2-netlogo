BBAE16502 Exercise (E2)
Due date: March 27, 2024 11:45
Human behavior plays a significant role in emergency situations of evacuations. By conducting simulations, researchers can explore how different elements impact the evacuation process and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of different evacuation approaches and plans.
In this exercise, you should:
* Import the image file "room.png" into your NetLogo environment.
* There are 200 guests in the room. The ages of these guests follow a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 12.
* Those who are under 60 years old walk faster and can forward 1 in a single tick, while people who are 60 or over 60 years old walk slower and can only forward 0.5 in a single tick.
> People in the room are very polite and well-educated, they don't push each other.
The program will stop until there is nobody in the room.
* Implement at least two strategies for evacuation and compare the time used under your proposed strategies.
You may consider using "monitor" or "plot" to illustrate your outputs.
• You can add any reasonable assumptions.
Please submit your NetLogo file and other related files (if any) to Moodle by 11:45.# BBAE16502 Exercise 2 netlogo
